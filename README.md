# kab üîê
kab the lab man

## What does it do?
**This does NOT deploy accounts / servers / services / or literally anything**
It is just a PASSWORD manager which let's you store passwords for your dummy accounts from the lab

> Enterprise applications are cool, especially when you setup them in a lab, but it can be a pain to keep track of every dummy account you make in it :(

This does help you keep track of accounts and machines (along with the services running on them), but it **won't 
do it automatically**, you have to **manually insert** every password using a form and they will be automatically
sorted beautifully in a table where you can later see

Usually people put their LAB credentials in a text file, notion, cherry tree or one note, these are **awful** 
  choices, this is why **KAB** has been written by __d4rckh__ using: NodeJS, Ejs, lowdb and lodash
